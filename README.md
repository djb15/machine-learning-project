# machine-learning-project

> Repo for machine learning project at Imperial College London.  The problem being solved is email spam classification.

## Get Started
To run my models, install all the required Python packages with `pip install -r requirements.txt` (ideally in a virtual environment but that is personal preference).  Also make sure you download the dataset from [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/spambase) and place the `spambase.data` file in the `data` directory.  Then run `python mlp.py` etc. to run the Scikit Learn model for each training classifier.
